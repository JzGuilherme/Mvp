# ManUp - MVP MEN'S HEALTH (UNINASSAU)

A web app focused on engaging the male audience in self-care, breaking the barrier of procrastination through health management tools.

# PROJECT STATUS
IN DEVELOPMENT

The project is a web app (not a website or blog) that requires user authentication (login/registration). The focus is on delivering a functional prototype that solves the pain points of our persona (the “procrastinating man”), according to the requirements of the 1st MVP Men's Health Call for Proposals.

# CONCEPT AND OBJECTIVE

ManUp is a private health platform. Users log in and access a control panel where they can actively manage their health, rather than just consuming passive content.

The main objective is to solve the persona's pain points:

“I always forget” -> Solution: Exam Schedule.

“I don't have the patience to learn the basics about health” -> Solution: BMI Calculator and Articles (direct links).

“College/work consumes me” -> Solution: Wellness Tips (on the Home page).

# MAIN FEATURES (SCOPE OF 6 SCREENS)

Authentication (Login/Registration): Secure login system for the user's private area.

HOME Screen (Dashboard): Quick access menu to tools and wellness tips section.

Health Calendar: (Critical Feature) Allows logged-in users to add, view, and manage their own health appointments.
